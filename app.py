    inspiration = '''
    The Edmonton Food Drive Project aimed to address food insecurity 
    in the local community by collecting non-perishable food and monetary
    donations for local food banks. It brought together community members,
    volunteers, and businesses to support those in need. Key lessons 
    learned from the project included the importance of effective community 
    engagement, efficient logistics planning for smooth collection and distribution,
    clear communication for coordinating volunteers, and the power of raising 
    awareness through social media and outreach to increase participation 
    and make a meaningful impact.

    what_it_does = '''
    The Edmonton Food Drive Project involved analyzing data related to food 
    donations and distribution patterns. Using this data, we developed 
    predictive models to optimize the donation process, identify trends 
    in donation volumes, and predict future needs. By examining key factors 
    such as donor behavior, seasonal trends, and donation volumes, we aimed to 
    provide actionable insights that could improve the efficiency of future 
    food drives. The project leveraged machine learning techniques to build 
    models that could assist in better planning and resource allocation for food banks.
